package main

// Create a struct named Person with three fields: FirstName and LastName of type string and Age of type int. Write a function called MakePerson that takes in firstName, lastName, and age and returns a Person. Write a second function MakePersonPointer that takes in firstName, lastName, and age and returns a *Person. Call both from main. Compile your program with go build -gcflags="-m". This both compiles your code and prints out which values escape to the heap. Are you surprised about what escapes?

	FirstName string
	LastName  string
